        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I am sixteen year old who has worked on many projects that work with
          both frontend and backend code and many using a combination of both to
          achieve the final product. <br /><br />
          One of my main interests is creating Discord bots because, well, I
          enjoy it. <br />
          Design isn't my strong point but I love getting to make something you
          get to see in action right away which makes bot development a great
          choice for me as they require little to no design and you get to see
          them in action right away. <br /><br />

            <h4>Shiro</h4>
            <p>
              Shiro is a Discord bot I made using a JavaScript library called
              <a
                href="https://discord.js.org/"
                style="color: inherit; text-decoration: none"
                ><strong>discord.js</strong></a
              >
              <br />
              <br />
              This library is used to create many different popular professional
              Discord bots and tends to be favoured over discord.py due to its
              use with the well loved programming language of JavaScript.

              Shiro Docs is a documentation website I made in order to make
              documentation easy to access and read to anyone using my bot.
              <br /><br />
              Shiro docs were built with
              <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</strong> to provide a basic overview
              of what Shiro can do as well as provide details on some useful
              commands to get started using the bot started. <br /><br />

              For year 10 futures I made my portfolio using <strong>HTML</strong>,
              <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to make and easy
              to adapt portfolio for easy of use. <br /> <br />
              The way I have wrote this site I can quickly and easily add in any info
              I need without needing to change the CSS or JS much. <br /> <br />

                  I made this custom Discord bot for my server. 
                  To be honest I started this sbecause I was really bored but after
                  I had a good base going I took the project more serious. I ended up
                  building it to where it is today completely solo.
